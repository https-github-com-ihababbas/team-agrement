#### Testability
Testing a web application is a complex task, because a web application is made of several layers of logic – from HTTP-level request handling, to form validation and processing, to template rendering. With Django’s test-execution framework and assorted utilities, you can simulate requests, insert test data, inspect your application’s output and generally verify your code is doing what it should be doing.


#### Security
Password generation: An application may not grant access until the user creates a strong password. For example, a strong password might contain a certain number of characters and a capital letter.
